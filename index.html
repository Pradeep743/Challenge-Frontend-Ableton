            <p>We feel the same way about making Ableton products. The driving force

                We are more than 350 people from 30 diferent countries divded between
                our heodquarters in Berl√≠n ond our ofices in Los Angeles ond Tokyo.
            </p>
            <p>Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us
                use Live and Push everyday. We come from a wide range of cultural and
                professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are self-taught,
                and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the
                shared belief that each of us has the skills and knowledge to
                contribute to something big: helping to shape the future of music
                culture.</p>

                We believe it takes focus to create truly outstanding instruments. We
                only work on a few products and we strive to make them great.
            </p>
            <p>Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our
                people what they need to work their magic and grow. We've learned that
                achieving the best results comes from building teams that are richly
                diverse, and thus able to explore problems from a wider set of
                perspectives. We don't always agree with each other, but opinion and
                debate are valued and openly encouraged.</p>
